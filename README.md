# documentation
These OpenDocument documents have been created to facilitate writing well structured easily readable documents.
They have been created using LibreOffice.

All documents are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

## Working with the templates
The documents are set to rely heavily on document fields, such as: Title, Subject and Custom Properties configurable by users.
The templates by default contain placeholder values for these fields so that it is easier for you to spot and change them. In LibreOffice you change the values by going to File -> Properties... and looking at General or Custom Properties tabs.
